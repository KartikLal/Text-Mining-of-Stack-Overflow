# Text Mining of Stack Overflow

#### Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/data

#### Data Description:
• The data consists of StackOverflow questions mainly related to math and programming, with ~6M records and 4 attributes
• Attributes: Unique ID, question title, the body of the question and the tags associated with the question.

#### Project Goal:
The dataset is by Stack Exchange, the largest open community for developers to learn and share their knowledge. We hope to generate the tags for each question based on a user’s question and the questions body using topic modelling algorithms. Tags are a means of connecting experts with questions they can answer and can also be used to help users identify questions that are relevant to them.
